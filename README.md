light-parallax-scroll
=====================

Simple light wight parallax scroll script. 

It simply scrolls two elemnts at different speeds/direction in relation to the rest of the html document.  The same method can be used to add livelier scroll animations.

I might add a demo with some markup in the future.

Check out [this](https://medium.com/@dhg/parallax-done-right-82ced812e61c "Parallax Done Right") useful blog post with lots of good tips on parallax animations.
